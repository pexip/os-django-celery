Description: Celery integration for Django
 Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
 distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation,
 but supports scheduling as well.
 .
 django-celery provides Celery integration for Django using the Django ORM and
 cache backend for storing results, autodiscovery of task modules for
 applications listed in INSTALLED_APPS, and integration of task monitoring
 through the Django admin interface.
 .
 Using it in a Django project provides a way to distribute asynchronous tasks
 like sending emails or batch-processing larger datasets to one or more
 separate worker nodes.
